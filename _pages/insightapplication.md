## 1. Ph.D Research

My main research area has been software engineering in Computer Science. My main research interests include software maintenance and empirical studies. I have been working on evaluating and improving the maintainability of software design quality using statistical, data mining and automated software analysis techniques.

In research on change-proneness prediction, I proposed the new behavioral dependency metric that captures the aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness model. (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project1/)

In research on refactoring candidate identification for the large-scale software, I proposed several new methods to find the cost-effective refactorings that can efficiently improve maintainability using dynamic information, multiple refactorings, and a two-step approach. (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project2/) For the scalable computing, I also provided a fast refactoring candidate assessment metric, which can evaluate candidates quickly using the matrix computation. (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project3/)

More information about my research and published papers can be found in the following links: [research](https://ahrimhan.github.io/research/) and [publications](https://ahrimhan.github.io/publications/). I have a personal webpage introducing about me: [homepage](https://ahrimhan.github.io/).


## 2. Skills and tools



## 3. Side Project / Ongoing Project (from kaggle, not academic)

My main research area is software engineering, and I have been doing research to improve the maintainability of software design quality. Software engineering provides systematic methods, automated tools, techniques, processes to assist developers for software development. Data science and software engineering are very similar in that they are both data-driven activities. Thus, all of my research projects are  closely relevant to data science. I list the project links explaining in detail the motivation, goal, method, and experiments.

In addition to the research projects, to help customers buy airline tickets, I analyzed the data affecting airplane ticket prices and used data mining techniques to find patterns. Data of airplane fares and the factors affecting ticket prices (e.g., season, week, time, and number of stops) are directly collected from Priceline and Kayak. I also collected external factors (e.g., oil prices) that can affect ticket prices. Based on the prediction that the airplane ticket will rise or fall tomorrow, I can assist customers to make decision whether it is good to buy an airplane ticket now (Buy) or better to wait (Wait). Here is the project link.

## 4. Course work

In Data Mining course in Spring 2008, I analyzed the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) data from 43 countries for a total of six years from 2002 to 2007 to find valuable insights of the advanced countries. I focused on Asia countries to make a model to suggest a direction for developing countries to become advanced countries. From the result of the analysis, to become advanced countries, I suggest developing countries should strengthen the capabilities of ``infrastructure``, ``business sophistication``, and ``innovation``. Here is the project link.
