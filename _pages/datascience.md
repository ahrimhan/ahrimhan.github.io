## 1. Ph.D Research

My main research area has been Software Engineering in Computer Science. My main research interests include software maintenance and empirical studies. I have used statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques to assess and improve the software design quality of maintainability.

In research on change-proneness prediction, I proposed the new behavioral dependency metric that captures the aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness model (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project1/).


In research on refactoring candidate identification for the large-scale software, I proposed several new methods to find the cost-effective refactorings that can efficiently improve maintainability using dynamic information, multiple refactorings, and a two-step approach (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project2/). For the scalable computing, I also provided a fast refactoring candidate assessment metric, which can evaluate candidates quickly using the matrix computation (https://ahrimhan.github.io/portfolio/research_project3/).

More information about my research and published papers can be found in the following links: [research](https://ahrimhan.github.io/research/) and [publications](https://ahrimhan.github.io/publications/).

## 5. Why data scientist? <a name="mg"></a>

From now on, I would like to work in industries for solving real-world problems and
performing more practical research. I would like to have a chance to work on analyzing
the large-scale data set and want to build my expertise as a data scientist. Based on
my research experience on predicting the software design defects and finding the costeffective
refactoring candidates, I want to expand my work to find the insights such as
predicting the user behavior patterns or estimating software failure rates by analyzing
the various kinds of data set (e.g., behavioral traces of user interactions with online
systems).

### Software Engineering and Data Science

My main research area has been **Software Engineering** in Computer Science.
The Software Engineering aims to provide the automated tools, techniques, processes to assist developers for the systematic software development.

In Software Engineering, we solve the problems such as `bug prediction`, `effort estimation`, `resource allocation`, `change propagation`, and `test case prioritization` that are relevant to data science.

I am eager to successfully transit the career from a researcher in Software Engineering to a data scientist.


From now on, I want to work in the industry to solve more real-world problems.
어렸을때 부터 분석하고 의미를 찾는걸 좋아했다.
컴퓨터 사이언스 엔지니어로써 공부할때도 사람들에 관심이 많아서 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야 **Software Engineering** 를 연구했었다.
지금 나는 아카데미아에서 회사로써의 트랜지션이라는 큰 도전을 페이싱 하고 있는데
내가 관심이 많고 잘 할수 있을 것 같은 직업인 데이터 사이언스로서 앞으로 커리어를 쌓고 성장하고 싶다.

내가 좋은 데이터 사이언스가 될 수 있는 자질은 다음과 같다.

   1. Strong research capability with the prediction research using statistical techniques  
   (strong research backgrounds)

   2. insight 찾는 능력

   3. Fast to learn new technologies and to adapt to a new environment
   빨리 배우고 성장
   I am eager to have an opportunity to work at Western Digital because of the brilliant colleagues and supportive working environment.


From the strong research backgrounds, I believe
I feel I can become an excellent Data Scientist in Western Digital. I am .




   * I can play a role well as an insight provider or a modeling specialist.
   I have used the statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques.

   * In the change-proneness prediction project, I proposed a more accurate predictive model using the metrics capturing the behavioral aspects of the program in conjunction with existing structural metrics.

   My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive model. I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness model.


   * In the refactoring identification project, to support developers applying refactorings, I proposed a method to suggest a list of refactoring candidates that would be expected to maximize the values in the maintainability metrics.

   Recent research was focused on defining the cost-effective software refactoring process by suggesting the refactoring opportunities that can maximize improvement in software design quality (e.g., maintainability), and I proposed the several new methods. 1) To extract the candidates in classes where real changes have occurred, I made the refactoring candidate identification model that uses the dynamic profiling technique measuring the most frequently used functions based on the several scenarios of user behavior. 2) To find a sequence of cost-effective refactorings, I proposed the method for selecting multiple refactorings that have no dependencies each other and can be applied simultaneously. 3) To reduce the search space of candidates to be examined, I suggested using the two-phase approach by choosing the candidates that are more likely to improve maintainability using the prediction model constructed based on the structural dependencies, change history, and textual information.

With all these considerations, even though I do not have the direct experience as a data scientist,
I believe I have the qualifications and skills to become a good data scientist.

Yelp Reviews (final)
1. 어떤 데이터 구할 수 있나
2. 어떤 분석을 할 것인가?
  * 어떤 인자들이 가게가 popular 해지는데 영향을 주는가? 빠른 시간에 하도록 하는가?
  * 어떤 리뷰에 신뢰를 안 가지는가? 거르는가?
    * 칭찬일색, 몇개의 리뷰가 없는데 별점이 매우 좋으면 의심, 짧은 리뷰 위주 (업체에서 리뷰 써주는 대가로 음식 제공한 경우일 확률 많음)
  * 유저들은 어떤 리뷰에 신뢰를 갖는가? 클릭수가 높은거? 잘 정리된 메뉴판 그림, 많은 음식 혹은 선명한 음식 사진들? --> 아마존의 amazon choice 처럼 리뷰가 필요 등 (elite member는 단순히 많이 쓴 사람? 많은 신뢰를 받은 사람에 대한 유저 정의 필요).


* Bug prediction
* Fraud news detection
* Challenge using Kaggle data set


## Reason to Transit from Academia to Industry
I was asked to have an example of code prepared. We spent a good part of the interview going over that code.
