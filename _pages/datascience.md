# Application

## 1. Ph.D Research
### Refactoring identification approach for efficient computing

My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive model. I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness model.

Recent research was focused on defining the cost-effective software refactoring process by suggesting the refactoring opportunities that can maximize improvement in software design quality (e.g., maintainability), and I proposed the several new methods. 1) To extract the candidates in classes where real changes have occurred, I made the refactoring candidate identification model that uses the dynamic profiling technique measuring the most frequently used functions based on the several scenarios of user behavior. 2) To find a sequence of cost-effective refactorings, I proposed the method for selecting multiple refactorings that have no dependencies each other and can be applied simultaneously. 3) To reduce the search space of candidates to be examined, I suggested using the two-phase approach by choosing the candidates that are more likely to improve maintainability using the prediction model constructed based on the structural dependencies, change history, and textual information.

## 5. Why data scientist?
I have studied Software Engineering in Computer Science, because it is
data science and

focus on software
such as
developers' productivity

transit and focus on people (user)
**business insights**
social behavior


`about.md`: I have the special interest in finding business insights by leveraging big data intelligence.

# Additional FAQ as an applicant in Insight

## Reason to transit from academia to industry
I was asked to have an example of code prepared. We spent a good part of the interview going over that code.
역동적인 산업체
실제 사람들이.

## Project in Insight

Reviews from customers
Facebook 'likes'
Yelp reviews
Amazon reviews
buying patterns
transit from knowing software to people (user)
help to make decision on
making better (high-quality) software in software

Yelp Reviews
1. 어떤 데이터 구할 수 있나
2. 어떤 분석을 할 것인가?
- 어떤 인자들이 가게가 popular 해지는데 영향을 주는가? 빠른 시간에 하도록 하는가?
- 어떤 리뷰에 신뢰를 안 가지는가? 거르는가?
칭찬일색, 몇개의 리뷰가 없는데 별점이 매우 좋으면 의심, 짧은 리뷰 위주 (업체에서 리뷰 써주는 대가로 음식 제공한 경우일 확률 많음)
- 유저들은 어떤 리뷰에 신뢰를 갖는가? 클릭수가 높은거? 잘 정리된 메뉴판 그림, 많은 음식 혹은 선명한 음식 사진들? --> 아마존의 amazon choice 처럼 리뷰가 필요 등 (elite member는 단순히 많이 쓴 사람? 많은 신뢰를 받은 사람에 대한 유저 정의 필요).


- Bug prediction
- Fraud news detection


## Why Insight? (+Cover letter)
아카데미아에서 회사로
분야도 바꾸어서
나라도 바꾸어서
이런 나에게 기회를 주는 프롣그램. 너무 감사하고 이런 프로그램을 알게 되어서 너무 럭키하고. 오퍼를 받게 된다면 최선을 다해서 정말 나의 있는 역량을 모두 발휘해서 보여주고 싶다.

## When can you move?
I am now currently want to work in Orange County, but I can move next summer to Silicon Valley area.

## etc (about.md 내용, cover letter, cv등 정비)

I am a research professor in the Next-generation Game Research Center at the Computer
Science Department at Korea University. My main research area has been Software
Engineering, and I have been working on assessing and improving software design
quality using statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques.

My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive
model. I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the
aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing
structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness
model.

Recent research was focused on defining the cost-effective software refactoring
process by suggesting the refactoring opportunities that can maximize improvement in
software design quality (e.g., maintainability), and I proposed the several new methods.
1) To extract the candidates in classes where real changes have occurred, I made the
refactoring candidate identification model that uses the dynamic profiling technique
measuring the most frequently used functions based on the several scenarios of user
behavior. 2) To find a sequence of cost-effective refactorings, I proposed the method
for selecting multiple refactorings that have no dependencies each other and can be
applied simultaneously. 3) To reduce the search space of candidates to be examined,
I suggested using the two-phase approach by choosing the candidates that are more
likely to improve maintainability using the prediction model constructed based on the
structural dependencies, change history, and textual information.

From now on, I would like to work in industries for solving real-world problems and
performing more practical research. I would like to have a chance to work on analyzing
the large-scale data set and want to build my expertise as a data scientist. Based on
my research experience on predicting the software design defects and finding the costeffective
refactoring candidates, I want to expand my work to find the insights such as
predicting the user behavior patterns or estimating software failure rates by analyzing
the various kinds of data set (e.g., behavioral traces of user interactions with online
systems).
