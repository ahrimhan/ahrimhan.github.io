## Software Engineering researches related to data science

My main research area has been **Software Engineering** in Computer Science.
The Software Engineering aims to provide the automated tools, techniques, processes to assist developers for the systematic software development.
%
In Software Engineering, we solve the problems such as `bug prediction`, `effort estimation`, `resource allocation`, `change propagation`, and `test case prioritization` that are relevant to data science.


## My previous research
My main research interests include software maintenance and empirical studies.
I have been working on assessing and improving software design quality using statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques.

<!--todo: data scientist cover letter-->

I have worked on making evolvable software.

//todo: importance of software Evolution

I have studied the following areas to answer the following questions.  
* **Change-proneness prediction**    
  * `Which parts of the software would be more frequently changed?`  


* **Refactoring candidate identification**
  * ``Where should be fixed to improve software quality and reduce maintenance costs?``  
  **(→ Recommendation system)**
  * `Which parts should be fixed first for the efficient improvement?`  
  `(within the limited budgets, resources, and time) (or among many number of refactoring candidates)?`

I am eager to successfully transit the career from a researcher in Software Engineering to a data scientist.

as a research professor and researched in assessing and improving software design quality.
My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive model using metrics measuring software design quality.

In recent years, I have been working on defining the systematic software refactoring process, especially for finding the refactoring candidates for fixing design defects.

From now on, I want to work in the industry to solve more real-world problems.
어렸을때 부터 분석하고 의미를 찾는걸 좋아했다.
컴퓨터 사이언스 엔지니어로써 공부할때도 사람들에 관심이 많아서 소프트웨어 엔지니어링 분야 **Software Engineering** 를 연구했었다.
지금 나는 아카데미아에서 회사로써의 트랜지션이라는 큰 도전을 페이싱 하고 있는데
내가 관심이 많고 잘 할수 있을 것 같은 직업인 데이터 사이언스로서 앞으로 커리어를 쌓고 성장하고 싶다.

내가 좋은 데이터 사이언스가 될 수 있는 자질은 다음과 같다.

   1. Strong research capability with the prediction research using statistical techniques  
   (strong research backgrounds)

   2. insight 찾는 능력

   3. Fast to learn new technologies and to adapt to a new environment
   빨리 배우고 성장
   I am eager to have an opportunity to work at Western Digital because of the brilliant colleagues and supportive working environment.


From the strong research backgrounds, I believe
I feel I can become an excellent Data Scientist in Western Digital. I am .




   * I can play a role well as an insight provider or a modeling specialist.
   I have used the statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques.

   * In the change-proneness prediction project, I proposed a more accurate predictive model using the metrics capturing the behavioral aspects of the program in conjunction with existing structural metrics.

   My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive model. I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness model.


   * In the refactoring identification project, to support developers applying refactorings, I proposed a method to suggest a list of refactoring candidates that would be expected to maximize the values in the maintainability metrics.

   Recent research was focused on defining the cost-effective software refactoring process by suggesting the refactoring opportunities that can maximize improvement in software design quality (e.g., maintainability), and I proposed the several new methods. 1) To extract the candidates in classes where real changes have occurred, I made the refactoring candidate identification model that uses the dynamic profiling technique measuring the most frequently used functions based on the several scenarios of user behavior. 2) To find a sequence of cost-effective refactorings, I proposed the method for selecting multiple refactorings that have no dependencies each other and can be applied simultaneously. 3) To reduce the search space of candidates to be examined, I suggested using the two-phase approach by choosing the candidates that are more likely to improve maintainability using the prediction model constructed based on the structural dependencies, change history, and textual information.

With all these considerations, even though I do not have the direct experience as a data scientist,
I believe I have the qualifications and skills to become a good data scientist.


## Projects

### [Change-proneness prediction](/portfolio/research_project1/)

Software changed either to add new functionalities or to fix bugs. Some part of the software may be more prone to be changed than others. Finding software parts that are more likely to change can be useful because we can decide how to effectively invest the software maintenance efforts. In previous studies, most of the metrics used to build a change-proneness predictive model are based on the structural complexity of software programs. To improve the accuracy of the change-proneness prediction, I proposed the new behavioral dependency metric that captures the aspects of the dynamic behavior program.
