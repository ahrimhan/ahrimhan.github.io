## Bug prediction

I am a research professor in the Next-generation Game Research Center at the Computer
Science Department at Korea University. My main research area has been Software
Engineering, and I have been working on assessing and improving software design
quality using statistical, data mining, and automated software analysis techniques.

My previous research was predicting change-prone parts of software by building a predictive
model. I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the
aspects of the dynamic behavior program, and these metrics in conjunction with existing
structural metrics help to make a more accurate prediction change-proneness
model.

Recent research was focused on defining the cost-effective software refactoring
process by suggesting the refactoring opportunities that can maximize improvement in
software design quality (e.g., maintainability), and I proposed the several new methods.
1) To extract the candidates in classes where real changes have occurred, I made the
refactoring candidate identification model that uses the dynamic profiling technique
measuring the most frequently used functions based on the several scenarios of user
behavior. 2) To find a sequence of cost-effective refactorings, I proposed the method
for selecting multiple refactorings that have no dependencies each other and can be
applied simultaneously. 3) To reduce the search space of candidates to be examined,
I suggested using the two-phase approach by choosing the candidates that are more
likely to improve maintainability using the prediction model constructed based on the
structural dependencies, change history, and textual information.

From now on, I would like to work in industries for solving real-world problems and
performing more practical research. I would like to have a chance to work on analyzing
the large-scale data set and want to build my expertise as a data scientist. Based on
my research experience on predicting the software design defects and finding the cost-effective
refactoring candidates, I want to expand my work to find the insights such as
predicting the user behavior patterns or estimating software failure rates by analyzing
the various kinds of data set (e.g., behavioral traces of user interactions with online
systems).
