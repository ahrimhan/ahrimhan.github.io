Biography
------
I worked as a research professor in the Next-generation Game Research Center at the Computer Science Department at [Korea University](http://www.korea.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) in South Korea. In 2013, I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html) in South Korea. KAIST was established by the Korean government as the nation's first research-intensive graduate school for science and engineering.
Thomson Reuters named KAIST the [most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asiapac-reuters-ranking-innovative-un/asia-pacifics-most-innovative-universities-2018-idUSKCN1J02SP) in 2018 and the [sixth most innovative university in the world](https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-2017/profile) in 2017.

My main research area was **software engineering** in **computer science** and I have been working on evaluating and improving software design quality using statistics, data mining and automated software analysis techniques.
My career began 2005 with the beginning of my masterâ€™s degree at [Software Engineering Laboratory](http://se.kaist.ac.kr/) at the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html).
During my master studies, I proposed the new behavioral dependency metrics that capture the dynamic aspects of the program contributed to making a more accurate prediction change-proneness model. This was published at IEEE International Conference on Computer Software and Applications in 2008 and was one of the best papers selected for the recommendation of the journal publication.
During my Ph.D. studies, I expanded my work to provide the systematic approach for the automated refactoring identification process and published the papers in [Journal of Systems and Software](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software), [Information and Software Technology](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology), and [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering](https://www.computer.org/web/tse).
You can reference the top ranking papers in the area of Software Systems released by Google Scholar [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems).


So far, as a first author, I have published 4 and 2 peer-reviewed papers in top-level journals and conferences, respectively. I received the two grants from the [National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)](http://www.nrf.re.kr/eng/main) and worked as a sole Principal Investigator. I also have served as a reviewer for many journals and conferences. I also have several successful experiences to mentor and teach students in the university. As a teaching assistant in software engineering classes, I played an active role in setting up assignments and exams and grading them.


From now on, I would like to work in companies for solving real-world problems.
I have the special interest in finding business insights by leveraging big data intelligence.
