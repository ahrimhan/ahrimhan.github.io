Here is my most recent resume [[pdf]](/files/resume.pdf).  

Biography
------

I worked as a research professor in the Next-generation Game Research Center at the Computer Science Department at [Korea University](http://www.korea.ac.kr/mbshome/mbs/en/index.do) in South Korea. In 2013, I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html) in South Korea. 

<!-- KAIST was established by the government as the nation's first research-intensive graduate school for science and engineering. -->

<!-- Thomson Reuters named KAIST the [most innovative university in the Asia Pacific region](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asiapac-reuters-ranking-innovative-un/asia-pacifics-most-innovative-universities-2018-idUSKCN1J02SP) in 2018 and the [sixth most innovative university in the world](https://www.reuters.com/innovative-universities-2017/profile) in 2017. -->

My main research area was **software engineering** in **computer science**.
Over 14 years, I have researched on evaluating and improving software design quality using statistics, data mining and automated software analysis techniques.  

My researcher career began 2005 with the beginning of my masterâ€™s degree at [Software Engineering Laboratory](http://se.kaist.ac.kr/) at the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) at [KAIST](http://www.kaist.ac.kr/html/en/index.html).
During my studies, I devised a more accurate prediction model to identify more change-prone parts of software programs. In this way, software developers can focus their efforts on more critical maintenance activities.
I also developed a recommendation system that helps software developers change code more easily by providing the code change candidates and their impacts quantified with software quality metrics. The research results had been published in top-quality conferences and journals such as [Journal of Systems and Software](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software), [Information and Software Technology](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-and-software-technology), and [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering](https://www.computer.org/web/tse).

* [Top ranking papers in the area of Software Systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems)

I received the two national grants from the [National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)](http://www.nrf.re.kr/eng/main) and worked as a sole Principal Investigator. I also have served as a reviewer for many journals and conferences. I also have several successful experiences to mentor and teach students in the university.

While doing research, I realized I am good at dealing with big data and finding new insights. **I am working to transit from academy to industry to work as a data scientist**. I am fast and love to learn new technologies. Recently, I have developed a deep learning model to automatically classify movie reviews in Python with Keras.
