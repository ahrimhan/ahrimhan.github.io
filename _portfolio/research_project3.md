## Motivation and Goal <a name="mg"></a>

The cost for assessing refactoring candidates is computation-intensive. For automating refactoring identification, previous studies have limitations for assessing the impact of a large number of refactoring candidates.

In our paper, we propose a fast refactoring candidate assessment metric, `Delta Table`. This metric is an efficient method for assessing the impact of refactoring candidates on maintainability based on matrix computation, which is approximate but fast. This metric helps to select the most efficient refactoring candidates for the large-scale software.


## Method <a name="method"></a>

### Assessment in the refactoring identification process <a name="overview"></a>
![researchDeltaOverview](/images/researchDeltaOverview2.png)
To identify refactoring sequence automatically, the possible moves of methods to classes in the system (i.e., refactoring candidates of ``Move Method``) are assessed the using the `Delta Table` and the most improving refactoring is selected and applied. This process is iterated until there are no more improvements.


### Software design is captured into a graph <a name="step1"></a>
![researchDeltadesign](/images/researchDeltadesign.png)
From the object-oriented source codes, the software design is captured into a graph. The entities of ``methods`` and ``attributes`` are mapped into ``vertices (V)`` and their relations such as ``method calls`` and ``attribute accesses`` are mapped into ``edges (E)``.


### Delta Table calculation <a name="step2"></a>

The ``Delta Table (D)`` is the ``matrix (rows: entities, columns: classes)``. Each element in the ``Delta Table (D_{ij})`` represents ``the variance of the number of external relations`` (i.e., relations across the classes) when moving ``entity i`` to ``class j``.

**Step of the ``Delta Table`` calculation**  
From the design graph, the link and membership matrices are constructed.
* ``Link matrix (L)``
  * ``L(e1, e2)``: entity `e1` has a relation to entity `e2`
  * ``Lint`` | ``Lext``: ``internal`` | ``external`` relations that are associated between entities ``in the same class`` | ``across the classes``
* ``Membership matrix (M)``
  * ``M(e, C)``: entity `e` is placed in class `C`

The projection matrix is produced by multiplying the link and membership matrices.
* ``Project matrix (P)``
  * ``P(e1, C)``: entity `e1` has a relation to an entity placing in class `C`
  * ``Pint`` | ``Pext``: ``internal`` | ``external`` project matrix
    * ``Pint = Lint x M``, ``Pext = Lext x M``


The formulation is devised by taking the effects (simulating) of moving entities.
* ``inverse function()`` is applied to the ``internal project matrix`` because moving an entity to other classes will potentially increase the external relations in the system. ``Inverse internal project matrix (invPint)`` represents the effects of increased external relations when moving entities that have had internal relations. For example, let an entity `ei` has a relation with another entity within the same class `C1`. When `ei` moves to other class `C2`, then the existing internal relation switched to the external relation: `invPint(ei, C1) = 0 (no effect)` and `invPint(ei, C2) = 1`.  


* ``inverse function()``
```java
  int [][] invPint = new int [num_entities][num_classes]; //inverse internal project matrix

  for (e = 0; e < num_entities; e++)
  {
    for (c = 0; c < num_classes; c++)
    {
      if (Pint[e][c] != 0) //an entity `e` has a relation with another entity within the same class `c`
      {
        for (i = 0; i < c; i++)
        {
          if (i != c)
            invPint[e][i] = Pint[e][c]; //moving entity `e` to other classes increases the external relation(s)
          else
            invPint[e][c] = 0; //remaining in the same class `c` has no effect
        }
      }
        invPint[e][c] = 0;
    }
  }

  return invPint;
```

* Similarly, ``minus`` is applied to the ``external project matrix`` because moving an entity to the classes that have had external relations will decrease the external relations in the system.


The final formulation of the ``Delta Table (D)`` is:
```
D = invPint - Pext
```

```
RQ1. Efficiency: By how much our method is efficient for assessing the impact of refactoring candidates?
RQ2. Usefulness: Does the refactoring identification approach based on our method help improve maintainability?
```

### Comparators  <a name="comparators"></a>
* ``Delta Table``(our approach) **vs** [``Entity Placement Metric (EPM) [Transactions on Software Engineering 2008]``](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4752842/)

### Evaluation measures <a name="evaluationmeasures"></a>

```
- Total time
- Maintainability metric: MPC (Message Passing Coupling)
```
For maintainability metric, [``MPC (Message Passing Coupling)``](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=170622) is used. ``MPC`` is a widely used coupling metric for measuring maintainability of software design. **The lower coupling means the more maintainable software**.


## Results <a name="results"></a>

### 1. Efficiency: By how much our method is efficient for assessing the impact of refactoring candidates? <a name="RQ1"></a>
> * The total time required to perform the refactoring identification approach with the Delta Table is much less than the approach with the EPM.
* Maximum time per iteration in our approach is the time for the first iteration.
* As system become larger, computation time is increased.
* Rate of increased time with respect to the system size is much less in our approach.

* **Total time (sec)**  
![graphCK](/images/researchDeltaResultTime.jpg)
  * The total time required to perform the approach with the Delta Table is much less than the approach with the EPM.
  * Maximum time per iteration: time for performing the first iteration including constructing the design graph, calculating the link and membership matrices
    (e.g., ``jEdit``: ``max. 5.95 [sec] > avg. 1.66 [sec]``, ``Columba``: ``max. 5.18 [sec] > avg. 2.33 [sec]``)
  * As system become larger (``jEdit: 952 classes, Columba: 1506 classes``), computation time is increased.
  * Rate of increased time with respect to the system size is much less in our approach
    (e.g., ``jEdit at 90 iterations, our approach: 154.63[sec], approach with EPM: 28,622[sec]``)

### 2. Usefulness: Does the refactoring identification approach based on our method help improve maintainability? <a name="RQ2"></a>
> The values of maintainability metric for our approach are increased in both projects (``jEdit`` and ``Columba``).

* **Maintainability metric for ``jEdit``**
![jEdit](/images/researchDeltaResultMPC1.png)<br>
**Maintainability metric for ``Columba``**
![Columba](/images/researchDeltaResultMPC2.png)
The maintainability metric of ``MPC`` for the refactored design at each iteration is presented. In the approach using the ``Delta Table`` for both ``jEdit`` and ``Columba``, the ``MPC`` decreases faster than the approach using the ``EPM``. The ``MPC`` is a coupling metric, and the lower ``MPC`` represents the more improved maintainable software.



## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

I propose a matrix computation-based refactoring candidate assessment metric. The metric in the ``Delta Table`` is the approximate measure, but it is sufficient to preliminarily assess the effects of the application of refactoring candidates in an extremely short time. This fast assessment can help the efficient refactoring candidate identification for the large-scale software.
